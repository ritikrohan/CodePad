# CodePad

React native Code Editor capable of syntax highlighting and code editing.
Bring the native language code and integrate it to this app and see the magic happen.


Works for both android and IOS.

for IOS you need to read documentation from React about how to use the Language modules in the code.

You can have local code compiler or you can run your in the server by just writing the backend logic in the Backend folder.
